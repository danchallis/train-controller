# train-controller
Create panel diagrams then use those to operate points, signals and trains.

This is the code I am creating to control my model railway that is loosely based on Exeter in Devon, England.

The hardware I need to control is produced by CTI-Electronics for the train control and monitoring of track sections.  I will be accessing it using the Acela interface.

Additionally extensive use is made of the Numato USB-GPIO boards for point in space control using IR LED's and also the USB-Relay boards for controlling points and signals.

The control system is all DC based.  There is nothing for DCC systems here.  The main reason I am creating this is because the standard commercial offering by Railroad and Co. does not support the hardware I wish to use.
